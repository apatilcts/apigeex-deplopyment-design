# Apigee X Deployment Solution

A web-based platform for managing API proxy deployments to Apigee X on Google Cloud Platform using GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps integration.

## Overview

The Apigee X Deployment Solution streamlines the process of deploying and managing API proxies on Google Cloud Platform's Apigee X. It leverages GitHub Actions for continuous integration and Azure DevOps for deployment orchestration, providing a unified dashboard for the complete API lifecycle management.

## Key Features

- **Unified Dashboard**: Centralized view of all API proxies, deployments, and environments
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Automated build, testing, and validation workflows
- **Azure DevOps Integration**: Sophisticated release management and deployment pipelines
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Configure and manage multiple environments (Dev, Test, Staging, Prod)
- **Deployment History**: Track and manage deployment versions with rollback capabilities
- **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Manage variables and settings per environment
- **Security Controls**: Role-based access and approval gates for production deployments
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Track deployment status and receive notifications

## Architecture

### System Architecture

The solution follows a layered architecture:

- **Frontend Layer**: Web UI dashboard built with modern web technologies
- **Middle Layer**: Service-oriented backend handling business logic
- **Integration Layer**: Connectors to GitHub, Azure DevOps, Apigee, and GCP
- **Data Layer**: Database and storage for configurations and deployment state

### Deployment Flow

1. **Code Commit**: Developer pushes API proxy code to GitHub repository
2. **CI Pipeline**: GitHub Actions triggers to build, validate, and test the API proxy
3. **Artifact Creation**: GitHub Actions creates deployment artifacts
4. **CD Pipeline**: Azure DevOps receives artifacts and initiates deployment
5. **Environment Configuration**: Environment-specific variables are applied
6. **Approval Workflow**: Optional approval gates for higher environments
7. **Deployment**: API proxy is deployed to Apigee X on GCP
8. **Validation**: Post-deployment validation ensures successful deployment
9. **Notification**: Stakeholders are notified of deployment status

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, TailwindCSS, Alpine.js, ApexCharts
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0, Service Account authentication
- **Integration**: GitHub API, Azure DevOps API, Apigee X Management API, Google Cloud API
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps Pipelines
- **Target Platform**: Apigee X on Google Cloud Platform

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Google Cloud Platform account with Apigee X enabled
- GitHub repository for storing API proxies
- Azure DevOps account for deployment pipelines
- Required permissions for GitHub and Azure DevOps integrations

### Configuration Steps

1. **GitHub Setup**:
   - Create/configure a repository for your API proxies
   - Setup GitHub Actions workflow templates
   - Configure required secrets and variables

2. **Azure DevOps Setup**:
   - Create project and pipeline definitions
   - Configure service connections to GitHub and GCP
   - Setup environment-specific release pipelines

3. **Google Cloud Platform Setup**:
   - Configure Apigee X organization and environments
   - Setup service accounts with appropriate permissions
   - Enable required APIs for integration

4. **Deployment Dashboard Setup**:
   - Configure connection settings for all integrations
   - Setup environment variables and deployment options
   - Configure user accounts and permissions

## Usage

### API Proxy Development and Deployment

1. Develop API proxy in local environment
2. Commit and push changes to GitHub repository
3. GitHub Actions automatically builds and tests the proxy
4. After successful CI, Azure DevOps initiates deployment
5. Monitor deployment progress in the dashboard
6. Approve deployment to production when ready
7. View deployment history and monitor performance

### Environment Management

1. Navigate to Environments section in dashboard
2. Configure environment-specific variables
3. Setup deployment rules and approvals
4. Monitor environment health and status

### Deployment History and Rollback

1. Access Deployment History in the dashboard
2. View details of past deployments
3. Compare deployment versions
4. Initiate rollback if needed

## Dashboard Sections

- **Dashboard**: Overview of deployment statistics and recent activities
- **API Proxies**: List and management of API proxies
- **Deployments**: Deployment operations and history
- **Environments**: Environment configuration
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Pipeline configuration and execution
- **GitHub Actions**: GitHub integration settings
- **Azure DevOps**: Azure DevOps configuration
- **Settings**: Application configuration options

## Security Considerations

- Use service accounts with minimal required permissions
- Implement approval gates for production deployments
- Secure storage of API keys and credentials
- Regular audit of user permissions and access
- Enable logging for all deployment operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Deployment Failures**: Check logs in GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps
- **Authentication Errors**: Verify service account permissions
- **Integration Issues**: Ensure API keys and configurations are correct
- **Environment Configuration**: Verify environment-specific variables

### Logging and Debugging

- View detailed logs in GitHub Actions workflows
- Check Azure DevOps pipeline logs for deployment details
- Access GCP Cloud Logging for Apigee X logs
- Dashboard provides links to relevant logs for each deployment
